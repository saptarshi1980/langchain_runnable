The Heart of the Game (with Messi)

On fields of green beneath the sky,
Where banners wave and spirits fly,
The whistle blows, the battle starts,
With roaring crowds and beating hearts.

A leather sphere, a sacred prize,
It spins through boots with dreams that rise,
From alleyways to stadium lights,
It weaves its song on endless nights.

Eleven strong with fire inside,
They pass, they press, they leap, they slide,
A perfect pass, a striker’s run,
A flash of gold beneath the sun.

Then comes a touch — so soft, so wise,
A flick, a glide, the crowd’s bright eyes,
He weaves through giants, small and fleet,
A poet dancing on his feet.

Messi — the maestro, calm and bold,
With feet that turn mere grass to gold,
He sees the game not as it seems,
But like a painter sees his dreams.

The clash of will, the dance of fate,
And every move he crafts is great,
He scores, he soars, the world’s alive,
The soul of football starts to thrive.

It’s more than game, it’s soul and flame,
A war, a waltz, a lover’s name,
And Messi, with a magic touch,
Has shown us why we love it much.

So here’s to football, fierce and free,
To every child with dreams to be,
And to the name that lit the flame—
Messi, forever in the game.
